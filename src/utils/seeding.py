"""Reproducibility helpers: global seeding + determinism toggles.

Used by both training (`src/train_loop_crf.py`) and inference (`infer.py`) so a
run can be reproduced bit-for-bit on the same hardware. Without this, a full
eval pass over the CRF/LSTM was observed to drift run-to-run (even ground-truth
residue counts moved), which is why fresh inference diverged from train-time
metrics. See memory note `deeppeptide-infer-divergence`.
